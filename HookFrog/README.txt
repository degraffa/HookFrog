How to play:

To move the player around

on the platforms:
A - move left
D - move right
space - tiny hop

hanging from a platform (tongue extended)
W - shorten tether/tongue
S - lengthen tether/tongue
A - swing (accelerate) left
D - swing (accelerate) right

To attach to an attachable platform (purple)
right click - in the direction you want the tongue to go. You must be within a certain distance to the point of contact in order for the tongue to stick. Otherwise nothing happens.

To detatch
left click 

Notes:
+ White birds are environmental hazards in this game. Currently if the frog touches them, the frog's tongue will detatch and the player will fall (usually to their demise).
